# The article page

## Goals

* Build a web page using **PHP**
* Use *includes*
* Use *variables*
* Use *arrays*

## Instructions

The goal of this Dojo is to complete the public/article.php script to display a complete web page

* Launch a php dev server with the public directory as web root
* Use *src/header.php* and *src/footer.php* to have *article.php* display a complete web page template
* Define a *$title* variable to choose the page title. This variable will be read by *src/header.php* to display the page title
* Define an *$article* array variable having the page title as key and a random text as value.

**Tips** : the *emmet* IDE plugin is able to generate a placeholder text by typping *loremX* where X is the number of words you want.

* Add an article to the page having the same title as the page and displaying the correponding text from the *$article* array as paragraph.
